For the error that is happening with workbox exceeding 2mb size limit I found a solution for it from this link: https://velog.io/@ide05484/ReactTypeScriptVITE-npm-run-build-%EC%97%90%EB%9F%AC-maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes

This is the error occurred when I was building knowledge hub as one of my project. I am documenting this so that later I will remember what happened. So basically the fix lies in the vite.config.ts file, where we need to tweak the workbox property of the pwa to increase the size of the workbox.
